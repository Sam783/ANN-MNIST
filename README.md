![ann](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99e768f7-5801-4c8d-88b0-472b91ab1b7b)

## Features
- Built a customizable neural network with any number of layers and neurons.
- Used ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax for outputs.
- Implemented forward and backward propagation with gradient descent.
- Used cross-entropy loss for classification.
- One-hot encoded the target labels.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras
