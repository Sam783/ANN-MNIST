# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from Scratch using NumPy on MNIST Dataset

## Features
- Build a customizable neural network with any number of layers and neurons.
- Use ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax for output.
- Implement forward and backward propagation with gradient descent.
- Use cross-entropy loss for classification.
- One-hot encode the target labels.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras
